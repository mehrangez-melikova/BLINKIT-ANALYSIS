# BLINKIT-ANALYSIS
 Project Overview: In this project, I conducted an end-to-end data analysis of Blinkit (a quick commerce delivery service) to understand user behavior, operational trends, and business performance. The goal was to derive actionable insights to help improve service efficiency, delivery timelines, and customer retention.
