# BLINKIT-ANALYSIS
 Project Overview: In this project, I conducted an end-to-end data analysis of Blinkit (a quick commerce delivery service) to understand user behavior, operational trends, and business performance. The goal was to derive actionable insights to help improve service efficiency, delivery timelines, and customer retention.


Key Objectives:
Analyze order patterns, delivery durations, and user frequency.

Identify high-demand categories and top-performing cities.

Evaluate time-based trends (peak hours, days with delays, etc.).

Build visual dashboards and draw insights from real-world data.


ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques Used:
Python Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, converted date/time columns, removed duplicates

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Distribution analysis, time-based trends, category-wise performance

Visualization: Built charts to show order frequency, delivery efficiency, and more


 Project Outcomes:
Helped identify operational bottlenecks by analyzing delivery time trends.

Suggested inventory prioritization based on demand patterns.

Developed a dashboard-ready dataset that could be used in Tableau or Power BI.
